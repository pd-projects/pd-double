Quick compilation instructions for Linux or Mac OSX:

In this directory, type "./autogen.sh". This will create the configure script.

Then type "./configure", possibly adding flags as follows:

    To put Pd in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin, add "--prefix=/bin".
    To put Pd in this directory, add "--prefix=/path/to/this/directory" (fill your path here).
    To enable jack support: "--enable-jack".
    To force a single precision build, add "--disable-double-precision".
    To force a double precision build, add "--enable-double-precision".

Then type "make"; and if desired, as superuser type "make install".

To run pd, either type the full pathname as in /home/me/pd/bin/pd, or else
if pd is installed in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, just type "pd".

Special instructions for Microsoft Windows: install cygwin and follow instructions as in linux or
Macintosh.
